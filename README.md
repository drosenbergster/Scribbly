# ✏️ Scribbly

**Where letters come alive through creativity**

An educational drawing app for children that transforms letter and number learning into joyful artistic adventures. Kids trace characters to learn their shapes, then unlock creative modes where they can turn those characters into imaginative artwork.

---

## 🌟 What Makes Scribbly Different?

Most educational apps drill letters and numbers. Most drawing apps lack learning goals. **Scribbly bridges both worlds.**

Kids internalize letter shapes through playful repetition—tracing, transforming, and making them their own—while building artistic confidence in a completely judgment-free environment.

> *Turn an "O" into the sun. Make an "S" slither like a snake. Watch learning become play.*

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. Trace Mode
Start by tracing letters and numbers that appear on screen. The character gently fades away, leaving behind the child's own creation.

- 📝 Audio feedback speaks letter names and sounds
- 🎯 Encouraging accuracy hints (never pass/fail)
- ⏱️ Adjustable timing settings
- ✨ Kids can never get "stuck"—progression is always possible

### 2. Creative Mode *(Unlockable)*
Once tracing is complete, the real magic begins. Kids can draw over, around, or incorporate the character into anything they imagine.

- 💡 **Inspiration Button** offers fun prompts and hints
- 🎨 Complete creative freedom
- 🏆 No judgment, just expression
