# Scribbly Research Handoff Document

**Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** Scribbly - Creative Learning App  
**Purpose:** Research handoff for child development and learning science research  
**Prepared by:** Business Analyst (Mary)  
**Status:** Concept refinement complete - Ready for research phase

---

## Executive Summary

Scribbly is an educational drawing app for children (~6 years old) that combines letter/number recognition with creative expression. Through our concept refinement session, we've clarified the core modes, feedback mechanisms, and user experience architecture. This document captures all key decisions and outlines the recommended research priorities.

---

## Core Concept Overview

### What Scribbly Is

An educational drawing app where children:
1. **Trace** letters and numbers to learn their shapes
2. **Transform** those characters into imaginative artwork
3. **Practice** motor skills and penmanship with adjustable feedback

### Key Differentiator

Unlike pure educational apps (drill-focused) or pure drawing apps (no learning goals), Scribbly bridges both worlds. Kids internalize letter shapes through joyful repetition—tracing, transforming, and making them their own—while building artistic confidence in a completely judgment-free environment.

## Refined Product Architecture

### Two Primary Modes

#### 1. Trace Mode
- Child traces letters/numbers that appear on screen
- **Adjustable Feedback System** (slider-based):
  - **Off:** No feedback, just tracing practice
  - **Low:** Subtle guidance
  - **High:** Active haptic vibration, visual guidance, accuracy scoring
- Character fades after tracing, leaving child's drawing
- Optional audio feedback (letter/number name/sound)
- **No failure states** - progression always possible

#### 2. Creative Mode
- Open-ended drawing using letter/number as inspiration
- Kids can draw over, around, or incorporate character into artwork
- **Inspiration Button** (optional, kid-controlled):
  - Audio prompts generated by AI
  - Personalized based on child's interests (set by parent)
  - Example: "Turn O into the sun!" or "Make S into a snake!"
  - Subtle and out of the way - not intrusive
- Completely judgment-free creative expression

### Key Design Principles (Confirmed)

1. **No Requirements or Gates** - All modes accessible from start
2. **Kid Autonomy** - Children control their experience
3. **Adjustable Guidance** - Feedback levels adapt to needs
4. **Judgment-Free Learning** - No failure states, only encouragement
5. **Creative Freedom** - Structure supports but doesn't constrain

## User Control Layers

### Kid-Accessible Settings
Children can control:
- Mode selection (Trace vs. Creative)
- Feedback level (slider: Off ↔ Low ↔ High)
- Colors
- Brushes/brush sizes
- Stamps and stickers
- All creative tools

**Philosophy:** Kids should be in control of their play experience.

### Parent-Locked Settings (Behind Gate)
Parents can control:
- Child's interest preferences (for AI prompt personalization)
- Time limits (if applicable)
- Content restrictions (if applicable)
- Progress visibility (if applicable)
- Other refinements

**Gate Mechanism:** Simple parental control (e.g., "hold two corners for 3 seconds" or math problem)

## Key Decisions Made in Refinement Session

### Decision 1: Mode Structure
**Original Concept:** Three modes (Practice, Trace, Creative)  
**Refined:** Two modes (Trace with adjustable feedback, Creative)

**Rationale:** Practice and Trace are similar enough to combine. Slider-based feedback system provides flexibility without complexity.

### Decision 2: Progression System
**Original Concept:** Must complete Trace Mode to unlock Creative Mode  
**Refined:** No unlocks or gates - all modes available from start

**Rationale:** Respects child autonomy. A creative kid shouldn't be forced to trace first if they want to draw.

### Decision 3: Feedback Mechanism
**Approach:** Haptic vibration + visual guidance + scoring  
**Control:** Adjustable slider (Off/Low/High)  
**Philosophy:** Provides guidance when wanted, freedom when not

### Decision 4: Inspiration System
**Format:** Audio prompts (not visual/illustrations)  
**Generation:** AI-generated based on letter/number  
**Personalization:** Based on child interests (parent-configured)  
**Trigger:** Kid-controlled button (optional, subtle, out of the way)

### Decision 5: Settings Philosophy
**Kid Layer:** Full control over creative experience  
**Parent Layer:** Oversight and refinement behind secure gate

## Research Priorities

### Priority 1: Child Development Research ⭐ (RECOMMENDED FIRST)

**Why First:**
- Directly informs current design decisions about feedback mechanisms
- Validates core learning approach assumptions
- Informs practice/trace mode structure
- Ensures age-appropriateness

**Key Research Questions:**

1. **Motor Skill Development:**
   - What are the motor skill development milestones for 6-year-olds?
   - How do fine motor skills develop for letter formation?
   - At what age/development stage do kids typically master letter tracing?

2. **Learning Letter Formation:**
   - What's the research on visual vs. kinesthetic (touch/movement) learning for letter recognition?
   - How do children internalize letter shapes - through repetition, visual recognition, or motor memory?
   - What role does spatial reasoning play in letter learning?

3. **Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Effectiveness of haptic feedback in learning apps for children
   - Research on corrective feedback vs. encouraging feedback for this age
   - When does feedback help vs. frustrate 6-year-olds?
   - Best practices for non-punitive accuracy feedback

4. **Judgment-Free Learning:**
   - Research supporting judgment-free approach vs. structured correction
   - How do failure states affect motivation and persistence in this age group?
   - What does "productive struggle" look like for 6-year-olds learning letters?

5. **Attention & Engagement:**
   - Attention span patterns for 6-year-olds
   - What keeps kids engaged vs. causes abandonment?
   - Balance between structure and freedom for optimal learning

6. **Creative Expression & Learning:**
   - Research on combining structured learning with creative play
   - Does creative transformation reinforce letter recognition?
   - How does artistic confidence affect learning outcomes?

### Priority 2: Competitive Analysis

**Research Areas:**
- Existing letter-learning apps - what works, what doesn't
- Popular drawing apps for kids - engagement factors
- Pricing models in education + creativity space
- Feature gaps and differentiation opportunities

### Priority 3: Technical Feasibility

**Key Questions:**
- AI prompt generation capabilities and constraints
- Haptic feedback implementation across iOS/Android
- Voice command libraries and accuracy for kids
- Offline AI processing requirements
- Multi-language support infrastructure

### Priority 4: User Testing & Validation

**Approach:**
- Ethical testing protocols with children
- Parent/caregiver interview frameworks
- Prototyping approaches that reveal real behavior
- Metrics for validating learning outcomes vs. engagement

## Open Questions for Research to Address

1. **Optimal Feedback Levels:**
   - What's the right balance of guidance vs. freedom?
   - How much haptic feedback is too much vs. not enough?

2. **Age Appropriateness:**
   - Is 6 years old the optimal target, or should we design for a range?
   - How do we accommodate slightly younger/older kids?

3. **Learning Outcomes:**
   - Can we validate that tracing + creative play improves letter recognition?
   - What metrics prove Scribbly achieves learning goals?

4. **Parental Involvement:**
   - What level of progress visibility do parents actually want?
   - Do parents prefer hands-off or hands-on experiences?

5. **Content Strategy:**
   - How many letters/numbers should be included initially?
   - Should content be progressive (A-Z) or choice-based?
